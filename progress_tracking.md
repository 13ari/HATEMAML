# Goal and deadline
Develop multilingual hate speech detection model.
Submission Due - ARR Nov 15, 2021 (ACL21)

# Done so far
1. Explored KGs for multilingual hate speech detection
2. Studied pre-trained LMs and cross-lingual transfer methods
3. Exploratory study on datasets and baselines

# To do's
1. Train baselines on HateEval19, LCS2 and SemEval20 
2. Selected baselines XLM-R, mBERT

# Tentative work outline
- Oct 13: 
  - implement proposed model
  - design experiments
  - simultaneously run relevant experiments
  - create an overleaf (ACL21)
  - organize experiment & results on overleaf Tables
  - prepare a report for meeting with profs
- Oct 20: 
  - jot down preliminary exp +analysis on overleaf
  - run more experiments
  - run ablation on zeroshot + few-shot
  - run experiments on domain adaptation
  - add ablations results on overleaf
  - discuss abaltions on overleaf
- **Oct 25**
  - Done so far:
    - Codes for training BERT, XLM-R, MAML and proposed modeling is working now
    - We have both zero-shot and few-shot setups ready. coding part is more or less done.
    - Produced primary results on SemEval2020 datasets. Full fine-tuning results yet to come. 
    - Our experiments seem okay for now on SemEval2020. 
  - Tasks schedule for 25 and before 28:
    - Produce all experimental results for SemEval 20 by Oct 25
    - Include rough sketch on proposed model diagram, modeling details and rough discussion on the results (finish by Oct 26 morning, Canada side)
    - Produce new results for HateEval19 and LCS2 (should be done by Oct 27)
    - Include HASOC19 and HASOC20 datasets for model training (finish it by Oct 2t)
    - Fill the number of shots table on SemEval20 (should be done by Oct 28)
    - Produce results for HASOC20 and HASOC19 (finish by OCT 29)
    - Start filling up `related works` section (Eshaan, within Oct 30)
    - Work on `proposed modeling` section overleaf (Rabiul, within Oct 30)
    - Work on `results discussion` section overleaf (Tanmoy, within Oct 30)
    - Notes: rough notes on overleaf is okay for now. Just fill it up with details. Can cut later.
  
- Oct 29 
  - finalizer experiments (stage 1) for SemEval 20, HateEval19 and LCS2
  - Put rough notes for `model`, `relate works` and `experiments discussion` sections
  - Do we need another table or any othe form of experiment? We must decide by now.
  - After Oct 29 ... there is no go back. We commit with what we have and refine our writing + experiments.

- Nov 1:
  - work on introduction draft
  - refine `modeling`, `related works` and `discussion` sections with proper information
  - finish the `table 2`, `3` and `4` with stdv and everything that we got. No cell can be empty at this point.
  - 
- Nov 10: paper draft ready
- Nov 15: paper submission to ARR
