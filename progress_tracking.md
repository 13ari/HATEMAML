# Goal and deadline
Develop multilingual hate speech detection model.
Submission Due - ARR Nov 15, 2021 (ACL21)

# Done so far
1. Explored KGs for multilingual hate speech detection
2. Studied pre-trained LMs and cross-lingual transfer methods
3. Exploratory study on datasets and baselines

# To do's
1. Train baselines on HateEval19, LCS2 and SemEval20 
2. Selected baselines XLM-R, mBERT
